# Product Display Clarity

**Product Display Clarity** is a plugin designed to enhance the player experience by appending display types (Fridge, Freezer) to product names, while intentionally excluding the Shelf display type to avoid visual clutter. This helps players easily identify the correct display furniture needed for each product, aiding better planning and inventory management without overwhelming the product names.

## Features

- **Display Type Integration**: Automatically appends the display type (e.g., `[Fridge]`, `[Freezer]`) to the end of product names, but **does not append `[Shelf]`** to maintain a cleaner interface.
- **Improved Clarity**: Ensures players know which display furniture is required for each product.
- **UI Integration**: Updates product names in licenses, notifications, and customer speech for seamless consistency.
